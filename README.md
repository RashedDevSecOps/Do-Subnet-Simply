# Class A Subnets
For Class-A subnetting, we just need to prepare the below table, now we will discuss how we can prepare the table.  

For making this table we already know that the default networrk bit is of Class-A is 8 and the default subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. 

Now we can write easily the first row as we know already the default borrow bit of class-A is 0, default number of subnet is 1 and the number of hosts/subnet are [(2^16)-2].
