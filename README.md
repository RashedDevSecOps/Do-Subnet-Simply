## Class A Subnets
For Class-A subnetting we need to prepare the below table, we will discuss how can prepare this table.  

For making this table we already that the default networrk bit is of Class-A is 8 and the default subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. 

Now we can write easily the first row as we know already the default borrow bit of class-A is 0, default number of subnet is 1 and the number of hosts/subnet are [(2^16)-2].
