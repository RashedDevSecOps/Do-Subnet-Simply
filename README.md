# Class A Subnets
For subnetting Class-A, we just need to prepare the below table. Now we will discuss how to prepare the table easily.  

For making this table we already know that the default networrk bits of Class-A is 8 and so the default subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. 

Now we can write easily the first row as we know already the default borrow bit of class-A is 0, default number of subnet is 1 and the number of hosts/subnet are [(2^24)-2].

# Class B Subnets
For subnetting Class-B, we just need to prepare the below table. Now we will discuss how to prepare the table easily.  

Similarly, for making this table we already know that the default networrk bits of Class-B is 16 and so the default subnet mask is 255.255.0.0. 

Now we can write easily the first row as we know already the default borrow bit of class-B is 0, default number of subnets is 1 and the number of hosts/subnet are [(2^16)-2].

# Class C Subnets
For subnetting Class-C, we just need to prepare the below table. Now we will discuss how to prepare the table easily.  

Similarly, for making this table we already know that the default networrk bits of Class-B is 16 and so the default subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. 

Now we can write easily the first row as we know already the default borrow bit of class-C is 0, default number of subnets is 1 and the number of hosts/subnet are [(2^8)-2].
